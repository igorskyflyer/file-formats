## üìç Introduction

`ADBT` files are template files that provide ways of writing reusable, component-like based Adblock filter files.  

`ADBT` are text-based, UTF-8 encoded files and use LFs for line-breaks.  

> üí° Even if you add CRLFs, the compiler will auto-convert them to LFs and the output file will contain only LFs.  

`ADBT` templates contain header and filter rule files that will get compiled to a single filter list file.  

`ADBT` files and their compiler `Aria` are Adblock syntax-agnostic, you are free to use any Adblock syntax.  

`ADBT` files can work in conjunction  with optional, complimentary files `*.adbt.meta`.

---

## üåà File information

<br>

`ADBT` file information:

Extension: `.adbt`  
Encoding: UTF-8  
Line break: LF

<br>

`ADBT meta` file information:

Extension: `.adbt.meta`  
Encoding: UTF-8  
Line break: LF  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è File structure

`ADBT` files follow an exact order and rules of their source code, described below:

- any line can be blank and all whitespace will be ignored when compiling
  - an explicit blank line can be used as well,
- any blank line can contain a comment (either internal or exported)
  - comments are not allowed to exist on the same line with statements,
- header files can be included multiple times
  - preferably, you should only have 1 header file and include it,
- filter files can be included multiple times,
- export statement **must** be the last statement of the file
  - only 1 export statement is allowed per template file

<br>

‚ùóEach `ADBT` template can be compiled to only 1 filter list file.

## üß™ Syntax

### ‚ö° Statements

##### `header`

> Imports a header file.

<br>

Accepts: `path: string`

<br>

Example:  

`template.adbt`
```shell
header './headers/my-header.txt'
```

<br>

Header files are plain text files and although not mandatory, they usually end with a `.txt` extension.

<br>

Adblock header files should contain the metadata that will be used for the resulting Adblock filter file.

<br>

> üí° Metadata is composed of special comments that describe your filter list closely, like the filter list title, number of entries, version, modified date, author, etc.

<br>

Here's an example:  

`header.txt`
```adblock
[Adblock Plus 2.0]
! Title: AdVoid.Core
! Description: ‚úà AdVoid is an efficient AdBlock filter that blocks ads, trackers, malware and a lot more if you want it to! üëæ
! Version: 1.8.1082
! Last modified: 2023-07-23T19:53:00+0200
! Expires: 6 hours (update frequency)
! Homepage: https://github.com/igorskyflyer/ad-void
! Entries: 2533
! Author: Igor Dimitrijeviƒá (@igorskyflyer)
```

The `header` should be at the top of the `ADBT` template file; comments are allowed before it.

‚ùóPath to the header file to include can be either relative or absolute but must be wrapped by single quotes. Failing to do so, will produce a fatal error.

<br>

#### `include`

> Imports an Adblock filter list file.

<br>

Accepts: `path: string`

<br>

Example:  

`template.adbt`
```shell
include './rules/domains.txt'
include './rules/cosmetic.txt'
include './rules/query.txt'
```

<br>

Filter list files are plain text files and although not mandatory, they usually end with a `.txt` extension.

The filter list file should contain **only** filter rules, i.e.:

`rules.txt`
```adblock
||somesite.abc^
||somesite.abc^
||somesite.abc^
||somesite.abc^
||somesite.abc^
##.someclass
##.someclass
! comment
##.someclass
##.someclass
##.someclass
```

It should **not** include any metadata - that should be included via the [`header`](#header) statement. Doing otherwise will result in metadata conflicts.
It can contain any valid filter rules and comments.

‚ùóPath to the filter list file to include can be either relative or absolute but must be wrapped by single quotes. Failing to do so, will produce a fatal error.

<br>

#### `nl`

> Generates an explicit blank newline.

<br>

Accepts: N/A

<br>

Example:  

`template.adbt`
```shell
nl
```

<br>

The newline will be present in the output/compiled filter file. Used to improve readability and/or organize your rules, see [examples](#-examples) below.

<br>

### üì¢ Comments

`ADBT` files support two types of comments:

`internal` &ndash; comments that are only visible in the template file but **are not** exported to the compiled file,  
`exported` &ndash; comments that are visible in the template and **are** exported to the compiled file.

<br>

#### Internal

> Internal comments are prefixed by an `@` (at sign, asperand) and are line-based.

<br>

Example:  

`template.adbt`
```shell
include './rules/domains.txt'
@ This is my internal comment
include './rules/cosmetic.txt'
@ This is my another internal comment
include './rules/query.txt'
```

<br>

#### Exported

> Exported comments are prefixed by an `#` (hash, pound, number sign) and are line-based.

<br>

Example:  

`template.adbt`
```shell
include './rules/domains.txt'
# This will be present in the compiled file
include './rules/cosmetic.txt'
# This too!
include './rules/query.txt'
```

---

### üîã Meta files

`ADBT` template files can contain a header file - as mentioned [here](#header) but in real-life use case we usually want to have a single, reusable header file with its metadata.

Unfortunately, a common header file most certainly has a property that should be different for every filter list file we compiled, in most cases, at least the `! Title: Filter name` should be different for every filter list file.

This is where _meta files_ come into play. Meta files are complementary files with an extension of `*.adbt.meta` that provide a way of having a dynamic header file that can be reused in all `ADBT` template files. We write placeholders in our common header file that get replaced at compile-time.

<br>

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Meta files are completely optional, use them only when needed.

<br>

Meta files have a special naming convention, if you fail to name them properly they won't be recognized by the compiler.
Meta files should be named after the `ADBT` template basename, see an example below.

<br>

`ADBT` template name: `my-filter.adbt`  
`ADBT` meta file name: `my-filter.adbt.meta`

<br>

In a nutshell, meta files' name should be:

> \<templateName\> + ".meta"

Meta files have a syntax of their own, even though you are already familiar with its base, JSON (if not, you can learn more [here](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)).  

üëÄ Continue reading to learn how to use meta file (and other) variables.

---

### üîÆ Variables

`ADBT` in conjunction with its compiler `Aria` provide a mechanism of using variables inside plain header/filter files in order to maximise efficiency, reusability and customizability.

<br>

There are 2 types of variables available:

- `meta variables`, template-based, local, stored in a `*.adbt.meta` file,
- `compiler variables`, compiler-based, global, available anywhere in the template file, computed during compile time.

---

#### ü¶† Meta variables

In its earliest stage, the current properties can be stored in a `*.adbt.meta` file:

- `title`,
- `description`,
- `versioning`

<br>

Each property in the `*.adbt.meta` file has a corresponding placeholder variable that you can use in your header files. Placeholders can have aliases. Placeholders provided by meta files are substituted during compile-time.

<br>

#### `title`

The title of the filter list.

Placeholders: `$(title)`, `$(file)`

<br>

#### `description`

The description of the filter list.

Placeholders: `$(description)`, `$(about)`

<br>

#### `versioning`

The versioning system of the filter list.

Placeholders: N/A

<br>

> ‚ùó Unlike the previous 2 variables, this is a compiler-behaviour variable only, it controls which versioning system to use for the exported filter list file, thus you cannot use it a header file for substitution.

<br>

Available options are:

- `auto`: **default**, let the compiler decide which versioning system to use. If the resulting file already exists, i.e. `Aria` already compiled the template before, it will re-use the versioning found in the file, otherwise it will use `semver`,
- `semver`: use valid SemVer versioning when exporting the filter file, e.g. v1.0.0, v2.199.222, etc.
  If no version is found the counting starts with v1.0.0,
- `timestamp`: use current UNIX timestamp, e.g. 1690409508.

<br>

#### üëÄ Example

Here's an example of how to transform a common header file to a reusable, dynamic one:

<br>

`my-header.txt` (not reusable)

```adblock
[Adblock Plus 2.0]
! Title: AdVoid.Core
! Description: Will block trackers.
```

If we were to include this header file via the [`header`](#header) statement in multiple `ADBT` templates all of the resulting files would have the title of `AdVoid.Core` which is wrong because each filter list should have a unique name and (optionally) description and version.

Now, let's use meta files and their variables to modify our header file:

`my-header.txt` (**_reusable_** !)

```adblock
[Adblock Plus 2.0]
!       üëáüèΩ we could use $(file) as well
! Title: $(title)
! Description: $(about)
!             üëÜüèΩ we could use $(description) as well
```

Now, the header file has 2 dynamic properties, `title` and `description`. They are represented by the placeholders and are pulled from your meta file when the template is compiled, thus, allowing you to provide custom and different values in the meta file for each template.

<br>

Here is an example of a template file, its corresponding meta file and the resulting, compiled filter list file:

<br>

`popups.adbt`

```shell
header './headers/my-header.txt'

include './rules/popups.txt'
include './rules/annoyances.txt'
include './rules/sticky.txt'
@ more includes if needed

export './popups.txt'
```

<br>

`popups.adbt.meta`

```json
{
  "title": "Pop Blocker",
  "description": "Will block popups."
}
```

<br>

`popups.txt` _(compiled)_

```adblock
[Adblock Plus 2.0]
! Title: Pop Blocker
! Description: Will block popups.
##.someclass
##.annoyance
##.someclass
##.xyz
##.someclass
```

### üíª Development

Even though technically you can write `ADBT` templates and meta files (`*.adbt.meta`) in any text editor, I highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor.  
<br>
The development of `ADBT` and its complementary meta files is available for Visual Studio Code via the [ADBT extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=igordvlpr.adbt) and it includes the following features:

- high-performance due to small footprint,
- language support and encoding for `*.adbt` files,
- syntax highlighting,
- auto-complete (Intellisense):
  - functions/statements (including path placeholders),
  - comments (including comment modifiers, i.e. `TODO`, `FIXME`, `NOTE`),
- hover information,
- snippets,
- meta files `*.adbt.meta` support, relies on built-in JSON support:
  - autocomplete (Intellisense),
  - hover info
